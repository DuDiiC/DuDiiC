  <h4 align="center">Programmer</h4>
  <p>I am working as a Java Developer for <a href="https://www.nmg.pl/en">NMG S.A.</a> In addition, I develop my skills, mainly related to <b>Spring Platform</b> and <b>Hibernate</b>.</p>
  <p>I focus on good programming practices and writing clean code. I believe these are the most important skills of a developer, regardless of the technology.</p>

  <h4 align="center">Student</h4>
  <p>I graduated Bachelor Degree studies in computer science at the <a href="https://www.mat.umk.pl/en/web/en/home">Nicolaus Copernicus University</a> with thesis about <a href="https://github.com/DuDiiC/engineering-thesis">prediction of the popularity of open source projects on the GitHub</a>. After that I started Master's at the same faculty. I am currently working on my master's thesis on Domain-Driven Design.</p>

| <img alt="Java" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/java/java-original.svg" width="30" height="30"/><br>**Java**<br>JDK 16 | Java is my main programming language, in which I regularly work and create projects since 2018. I am up to date with changes in Java, including the latest versions of the JDK. | <img alt="Spring" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/spring/spring-original.svg" width="30" height="30"/><br>**Spring Platform** | After learning the basics of Java, the next step for me was to develop skills correlated with Spring Platform. In many projects, I mainly used Spring projects such as: Spring Boot, Spring Framework, Spring Data and Spring Security. |
| <img alt="Hibernate" src="https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/hibernate.svg" width="30" height="30"/><br>**JPA**<br>**Hibernate**<br>EclipseLink | I regularly use Hibernate mainly as a JPA provider for Spring, I also had contact with EclipseLink | <img alt="Databases" src="https://i.dlpng.com/static/png/6479833_preview.png" width="30" height="30"/><br>**Relational databases**<br>+ SQL | I use SQL in practice and have had contact with most of the largest relational DBSMs: Oracle, MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL and MySQL, but I have the most experience with the first two. In addition, I am familiar with Flyway and Liquibase. |
| <img alt="Git" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/git/git-original.svg" width="30" height="30"/><br>**Git**<br>SVN | I use version control systems every time I write code. I understand the advantages of a distributed systems like Git because I also work with Subversion. | <img alt="InteliiJ IDEA" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/IntelliJ_IDEA_Icon.svg/1024px-IntelliJ_IDEA_Icon.svg.png" width="30" height="30"/><br> **InteliiJ IDEA** | JetBrains IDEs are my favorites tools to their efficiency, ease of use and comfort of work. Not only for Java, but also for C/C++ and Python. |

<h3 align="center">I know basics</h3>

| | |
| :---: | :--- |
| JUnit5, AssertJ, Mockito | I work with these libraries to create unit and integration tests on my projects. I use TDD from time to time. |
| JavaFX, Java EE | I know the basics of JavaFX from my [student project](https://github.com/DuDiiC/swimming-contests-manager-client-app) and I use Java EE at work. |
| Python3, Pandas, sklearn | I work a lot with python at university, mostly with machine learning and data analysis libraries. I also wrote an [engineering thesis](https://github.com/DuDiiC/engineering-thesis) in Python. |
| C, C++, Qt | I worked with these technologies in classes related to algorithmics and [computer graphics](https://github.com/DuDiiC/studies-4th-semester-graphics). C ++ was the first language I started learning programming with. |
| HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js | I learned the basics of web technologies by creating two projects - a simple [front to my notes app](https://github.com/DuDiiC/web-notes-front) and working on the [Tutio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2OD6eTyO0c&feature=emb_title) team project at university. |
| Docker | Containerization is a very interesting topic that I am currently exploring and starting to implement in my projects. |

#### Tutio - online tutoring platform
Tutio is a comprehensive platform for organizing online tutoring, including video calling, screen sharing and payment system for classes.
In this project, I was responsible for creating the server, API and the visual part of the front-end of the application.
You can see full presentation (in Polish) [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2OD6eTyO0c&feature=emb_title).

#### Web notes
A small project, presenting my skills in programming in Java and Spring.
