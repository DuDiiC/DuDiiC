### ✔ Java/Back-end developer ✔ UMK student ✔ programming enthusiast

#### Programmer
I have been learning programming on my own for over three years. I started with C ++, but during my studies I also got to know C and Python, but currently my main programming language is Java and the Spring platform. In addition to typical back-end applications, I also tried programming for the android platform in Java and React.js on the front-end.

#### Student
Currently, the sixth semester at the University of Nicholas Copernicus University in Toruń, majoring in computer science. Many of the repositories show my work in college.

## Most important projects:

### Tutio - online tuting platform
Tutio is a comprehensive platform for organizing online tutoring, including video calling, screen sharing and payment system for classes.  
In this project, I was responsible for creating the server, API and the visual part of the front-end of the application.
