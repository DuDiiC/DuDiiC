#### Programmer

I started my adventure with programming about half a year earlier than my studies. Since then, I have been developing my skills, especially in technologies related to Java, Spring and OOP in general, but I tried many other technologies too. I started with C ++, but during my studies I also got to know C and Python. In addition to typical back-end applications, I also tried programming for the android platform in Java and React.js on the front-end. 

I am interested in further development in this field and practical learning. I belive that programming, clean code writing and logical thinking are technology-independent skills. 

#### Student

Currently, the sixth semester at the University of Nicholas Copernicus University in Toru≈Ñ, majoring in computer science. Many of the repositories show my work in college.

I am working on an engineering thesis on predicting the future of projects on the GitHub platform.

## Most important projects:

### Tutio - online tuting platform
Tutio is a comprehensive platform for organizing online tutoring, including video calling, screen sharing and payment system for classes.  
In this project, I was responsible for creating the server, API and the visual part of the front-end of the application.  
You can see full presentation (in Polish) [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2OD6eTyO0c&feature=emb_title).

### Web notes
A small project, presenting my skills in programming in Java and Spring.
