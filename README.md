  <h4 align="center">Programmer</h4>
  <p>I am working as a Java Developer for <a href="https://bluesoft.com/">BlueSoft</a> In addition, I develop my skills, mainly related to <b>Spring Platform</b> and <b>Hibernate</b>.</p>
  <p>I focus on good programming practices and writing clean code. I believe these are the most important skills of a developer, regardless of the technology. My approach to programming can be briefly described with a quote from one of Uncle Bob's presentations:</p>
  <p align="right"><em>"You are not done when it works, you are done when it's right."</em></p>

  <h4 align="center">Student</h4>
  <p>I graduated Bachelor Degree studies in computer science at the <a href="https://www.mat.umk.pl/en/web/en/home">Nicolaus Copernicus University</a> with thesis about <a href="https://github.com/DuDiiC/engineering-thesis">prediction of the popularity of open source projects on the GitHub</a>. After that I started Master's at the same faculty. I am currently working on my master's thesis related to <b>Domain-Driven Design.</b></p>

| <img alt="Java" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/java/java-original.svg" width="30" height="30"/><br>**Java** | Java is my main programming language, in which I regularly work and create projects since 2018. I am up to date with changes in Java, including the latest versions of the JDK. | <img alt="Spring" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/spring/spring-original.svg" width="30" height="30"/><br>**Spring Platform** | After learning the basics of Java, the next step for me was to develop skills correlated with Spring Platform. In many projects, I mainly used Spring projects such as: **Spring Boot, Spring Framework, Spring Data and Spring Security**. |
| <img alt="Hibernate" src="https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/hibernate.svg" width="30" height="30"/><br>**JPA**,<br>**Hibernate**,<br>EclipseLink | I regularly use Hibernate mainly as a JPA provider for Spring, I also had contact with EclipseLink. | <img alt="Databases" src="https://i.dlpng.com/static/png/6479833_preview.png" width="30" height="30"/><br>**Relational databases**<br>+ SQL | I use SQL in practice and have had contact with most of the largest relational DBSMs: Oracle, MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL and MySQL, but I have the most experience with the first two. In addition, I am familiar with Flyway and Liquibase. |
| <img alt="Git" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/git/git-original.svg" width="30" height="30"/><br>**Git**,<br>SVN | I use version control systems every time I write code. I understand the advantages of a distributed systems like Git because I also work with Subversion. | <img alt="InteliiJ IDEA" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/IntelliJ_IDEA_Icon.svg/1024px-IntelliJ_IDEA_Icon.svg.png" width="30" height="30"/><br> **InteliiJ IDEA** | JetBrains IDEs are my favorites tools to their efficiency, ease of use and comfort of work. Not only for Java, but also for C/C++ and Python. |

<h3 align="center">I know basics</h3>

| | |
| :---: | :--- |
| JUnit5, AssertJ, Mockito | I work with these libraries to create unit and integration tests on my projects. I use TDD from time to time. |
| JavaFX, Java EE | I know the basics of JavaFX from my [student project](https://github.com/DuDiiC/swimming-contests-manager-client-app) and I use Java EE at work. |
| Python3, Pandas, sklearn | I work a lot with python at university, mostly with machine learning and data analysis libraries. I also wrote an [engineering thesis](https://github.com/DuDiiC/engineering-thesis) in Python. |
| C, C++, Qt | I worked with these technologies in classes related to algorithmics and [computer graphics](https://github.com/DuDiiC/studies-4th-semester-graphics). C ++ was the first language I started learning programming with. |
| HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js | I learned the basics of web technologies by creating two projects - a simple [front to my notes app](https://github.com/DuDiiC/web-notes-front) and working on the [Tutio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2OD6eTyO0c&feature=emb_title) team project at university. |
| Docker | Containerization is a very interesting topic that I am currently exploring and starting to implement in my projects. |

<h3 align="center">Most important projects</h3>

#### Scheduler (in progress)

App for managing the timetable. Created to practice the docker, flyway, testing, CI/CD and CRQS-based architecture. 
More details in [project repository](https://github.com/DuDiiC/scheduler).

#### Web notes
Designed an CRUD application for creating, managing, and storing notes in Markdown. 
Implemented with Java and Spring platform, included security (JWT, mail verification) and REST API. A simple web application in React.js has also been implemented.
More details in the [server repository](https://github.com/DuDiiC/web-notes).

#### Tutio - online tutoring platform

Developed a platform for organizing online tutoring, featuring video calls, screen sharing, real-time text chat, and a~payment system. 
The server is implemented in \textbf{Java} and \textbf{Spring}, and uses REST API for data sharing. The web app utilizes React.js and Peer.js. 
The application was created in a team of 6 people.
Main tasks: architecture design, server management and REST API.

You can see full (in Polish in both cases) project [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2OD6eTyO0c&feature=emb_title) or [documentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DvVRPu-kxHAo4RgvFkZ4JnJCC5EK06Wh/view?usp=sharing).

#### Swimming Contests Manager

Designed an CRUD application for managing swimming contents, prepared as server with REST API (based on Spring Boot) and client desktop app (in JavaFX with Hibernate).
It was the first full project written in Java-related technologies, more details in the [server](https://github.com/DuDiiC/swimming-contests-manager-server) and [client](https://github.com/DuDiiC/swimming-contests-manager-client) repositories.
